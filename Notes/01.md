- Components  In the react native anything you build is made of the components .
 - We can create the multiple components and use them to build the flexible UI .
  `Text` This is the compoment in th react native code that is used to display the text in the screen .
   Nesting of the text component is alwayas allowed .
   In react native any text on the screen need to be inside the text component.
  ` View` This is the another layout used to create the layout and structure for the user interface. It behave live a div . It is used to group and the organise the other components together .
   - Layout refers to the arrangement of the visual of the  element on a screen or in the page . It is crucial that involve the styling of the components .
 `Textinput` is used to capture the user input .
 ` WebView` This is used to render the web components .
 ` Modal` This is used to present the content above the enclosing view .
 `Layout` Flexbox is used for layout  .
 `SectionList` It is allows grouping of the data into the section .
 `ScrollView` It allows you to scroll through the content that overflows the screen .
 ` 
 `Button` These are the simple clickable component for handling user intersections .
 - Learning about the container on the screen for the making different use of the container in the same screen .
  - Flex helps to distribute the space in the container . It helps to   create the specific size for the particular container and resize based on the available space in the parent contaienr.
  `UseState`
   - It is a hook in function and react native that allows you to add state the functional componets . It lets you to state variable that be updated causing the components to re render when the state change ,

- `npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack` This is used to make sure if the navigation stack is working properly or not .
`npm install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated react-native-screens @react-native-community/masked-view @react-navigation/stack` This is insure all the things at the one place .

- `./gradlew clean ` For this go into the android dir and run this command this will clean the previous build and make it new release .
